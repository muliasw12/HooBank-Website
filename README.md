Business digital payment refers to the use of electronic means for financial transactions in business activities. The introduction of digital payment systems has revolutionized the way businesses operate, making transactions faster, more secure, and more convenient. Digital payment methods include debit and credit card payments, electronic transfers, mobile payments, and online payment gateways, among others. These digital payment systems have reduced the dependence on cash and traditional methods of payment, increasing efficiency and reducing the risk of fraud. The widespread adoption of digital payment technologies has also paved the way for the growth of e-commerce and online business, further expanding the reach of digital payments in the business world. In this project, I created a modern HooBank website using React JS and Tailwind css. 

Using Tailwind CSS allows developers to quickly build custom user interfaces by reusing pre-designed CSS classes, reducing the development time and effort and also provides a comprehensive set of responsive classes for different screen sizes, ensuring that user interfaces are optimized for different devices. This is my first project using tailwind css.
